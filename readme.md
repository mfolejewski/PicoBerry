# PicoBerry - miniature Raspberry Pi CM4 carrier board with full 40-pin GPIO header

## Description

PicoBerry is a tiny Raspberry Pi CM4 carrier board, which has technical specification, as following:
- USB-C for power supply (5VDC/3A),
- full 40-pin GPIO header for connecting HAT boards,
- 2x user LEDs (green/red),
- support only CM4 versions (with eMMC onboard, CM4 Lite are not supported),
- standard ACT/PWR LEDs,
- 2-layer PCB, 20x70mm,
- fully open source project (OSHW).

You can connect to the CM4 module standard HAT boards, such as LCD screens (with SPI or DPI interfaces), audio DAC boards, RS232/485 or CAN interfaces, and many more...

Here you can find:
- \photos: a few pictures of the assembled PCB boards and design
- \manufacturing files: all the production files for ordering PCB and assembly at JLCPCB (Gerber files, Pick & Place, BOM, etc.)
- \source files: source files in KiCad and Altium Designer format
